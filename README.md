# event-Vue-showcase

- To run this locally, simply download and extract, run 'npm install' to get the dependacies.
- Then its recomemnded to run 'npm update' to make sure they are all up-to-date.
- Launch the Vue app with 'npm run serve', however to see the example date there is one more step.
- Lauch the Json server data in a seperate terminal via 'json-server --watch db.json', or to really feel the loading times and admire the progress bar + spinner, type: 'json-server -d 1500 db.json' which adds a 1.5 second delay for the API call.

## Building a modular Vue event case shower.

## Second is to build a heroku host API for the db.json so that AXIO calls that instead of using localhost Json-server all the time.

## Lastly make a server.js with Express and also setup for heroku deployment.
